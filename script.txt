<Rowan>: In a small village north of Kyoto, the school bell rings at eight thirty AM sharp. But when the doors open... no children run inside. The classrooms stand empty, desks gathering dust. The youngest resident here is sixty two years old.  

<Alex>: That’s not some dystopian thought experiment... that’s happening right now in dozens of towns across Japan.  

<Rowan>: Exactly. And here’s why it matters today - Japan just recorded its sixteenth straight year of population decline, losing a record nine hundred thousand people in twenty twenty four alone. Births have dropped below seven hundred thousand... compared to two million per year back in the nineteen seventies.  

<Alex>: That math is terrifying. And it’s not just about empty schools - this is reshaping everything from pensions to who’ll care for the elderly.  

<Rowan>: I’m Rowan, and today we’re unraveling how Japan reached this demographic crossroads... and whether it can find a way forward.  

<Alex>: I’m Alex. We’ll meet women delaying motherhood because their bosses won’t give them maternity leave, villages paying couples to move there, and robots being trained to care for the elderly.  

<Rowan>: By the end, you’ll understand why Japan’s crisis might be a preview of what other nations will face... and what happens when a society literally starts vanishing.
