<Rowan> Hey everyone! I'm already excited about today's topic. I actually visited this place last summer, and I still can't wrap my head around how they built it.
<Alex> Well, you're in for a treat because today we're exploring one of the most remarkable structures ever built in Britain... Hadrian's Wall. Just imagine this... a massive stone barrier that has stood for one thousand nine hundred years, weathering everything from ancient battles to modern pollution, and we still debate exactly why it was built.
<Rowan> One thousand nine hundred years? That's incredible. And it's not just some small fence we're talking about, right?
