## üìã Usage Guide

### 1. Script Input
1. Navigate to the **Generator** tab
2. Enter your dialogue script using the format:
   ```
   <Alex> Welcome to our show!
   <Sarah> Thanks for having me, Alex.
   <Alex> Today we're discussing...
   ```
3. The system automatically detects speakers and validates format

### 2. Voice Assignment
1. Once speakers are detected, the **Voice Assignment** panel appears
2. Select voices for each speaker from your available voice library
3. Use the preview button to test voices before generation
4. The system attempts auto-assignment based on available voices

### 3. Quality Settings
- **Speed Mode**: Fast generation with SSE (22kHz)
- **Highest Quality**: Studio quality with Longform (48kHz)
- **Custom Settings**: Manual control over sampling rate and encoding

### 4. Audio Generation
1. Click **Generate Dialogue** once all speakers have assigned voices
2. Wait for generation to complete (time varies by quality setting)
3. Use the built-in audio player to preview results
4. Download the generated dialogue as a WAV file

### 5. Voice Library Management
1. Switch to the **Voice Library** tab
2. Browse all available preset and cloned voices
3. Preview any voice with sample text
4. (Future) Clone new voices from audio samples

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 15.4**: React framework with App Router
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework
- **Lucide React**: Modern icon library
- **React Hooks**: State management with useState/useEffect

### Backend Integration
- **FastAPI Wrapper**: `backend_api.py` exposes your Python backend as REST API
